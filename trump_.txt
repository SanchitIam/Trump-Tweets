Nielson Media Research final numbers on ACCEPTANCE SPEECH: TRUMP  32.2 MILLION.  CLINTON 27.8 MILLION.  Thank you!Thank you to all of the television viewers that made my speech at the Republican National Convention #1 over Crooked Hillary and DEMS.Can you imagine if I had the small crowds that Hillary is drawing today in Pennsylvania. It would be a major media event! @CNN @FoxNewsNATO commander agrees members should pay up via @dcexaminer:http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/nato-commander-agrees-members-should-pay-up/article/2598183?custom_click=rss …Wow, NATO's top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must PAY THEIR BILLS. This is a general I will like!The "Rust Belt" was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico. END!Crooked's stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians, drew less than 200 - with Bill, VP#CrookedHillary = Obama's third term, which would be terrible news for our economic growth - seen below.pic.twitter.com/y9WJoUaaqlWord is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two "Big Thursdays" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won ratings#CrookedHillarypic.twitter.com/xyoPFJmBypCrooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes. A formula for disaster!Violent crime is rising across the United States, yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities.Just got back from Colorado.

She is owned by Wall Street!Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.Departing now - thank you Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

NO!Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally.

Did Bernie go home and go to sleep?I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention!No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated!You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is, and neither does ISIS (a good thing). Please get your facts straight - thanks. @megynkellyFor the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia.In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster, the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump.

Sad to watch.Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. The Republican Convention was greatFunny, if you listen to @FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a differenceBernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke!While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.Clinton betrayed Bernie voters.

But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie.If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same.Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgainpic.twitter.com/Pzs9uwgzamHillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie!The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes meWatched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing!The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out!The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed outIf the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wildThe @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.)Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECTThe Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain

The Republican Convention was greatFunny, if you listen to @FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a differenceBernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine.

No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing!The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out!The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed outIf the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wildThe @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.)Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement!

WI: https://www.donaldjtrump.com/schedule/register/grand-rapids-mi1/ …Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. PatheticOur not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to "carpet bomb" the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz!Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said "Trump is a genius." America 1st!As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv.Just like I have warned from the beginning, Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP.http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/terry-mcauliffe-hillary-clinton-tpp-trade-226253 …Many of Bernie's supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep?I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention!No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated!You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is, and neither does ISIS (a good thing). Please get your facts straight - thanks. @megynkellyFor the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia.In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster, the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump. Crazy!#CrookedHillary
https://instagram.com/p/BIVl0JHDO2G/ Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS & her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here.Bernie's exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed!The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!Thank you New Hampshire!

Sad to watch.Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. The Republican Convention was greatFunny, if you listen to @FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a differenceBernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke!While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War.Thank you OHIO! #TrumpPence16

People don't want another four years of Obama, and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGAThe State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie.If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same.Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgainpic.twitter.com/Pzs9uwgzamHillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie!The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes meWatched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing!The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out!The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed outIf the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wildThe @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.)Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECTThe Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain

ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGEDPocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her!Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for.

The Republican Convention was greatFunny, if you listen to @FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a differenceBernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke!While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.Clinton betrayed Bernie voters.

But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie.If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same.Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgainpic.twitter.com/Pzs9uwgzamHillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie!The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes meWatched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing!The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out!The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed outIf the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wildThe @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.)Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement!

I made a fortune off of debt, will fix U.S.Obama-Clinton inherited $10T in debt and turned it into nearly $20T.  They have bankrupted… https://www.instagram.com/p/BG7IYzumhZw/ Hillary Clinton's open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all Americans - and make everyone less safe.How can Hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk?Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as
Secretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs.Hillary says this election is about judgment.  She's right.  Her judgement has killed thousands, unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy.I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton.Crooked Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to be our president-really bad judgement and a temperament, according to new book, which is a mess!When I said that if, within the Orlando club, you had some people with guns, I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees.@DJohnsonPGA We are so proud of you Dustin.

Can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate!Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser, but if the GOP can't control their own, then they are not a party.

Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant, but leaves behind amazing legacy.Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton’s flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American.Let’s properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren’s records to see if she is Native American.

What a differenceBernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine.

People don't want another four years of Obama, and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGAThe State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie.If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same.Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgainpic.twitter.com/Pzs9uwgzamHillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie!The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes meWatched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing!The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out!The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed outIf the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wildThe @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.)Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECTThe Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain

ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGEDPocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her!Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?"@Theresa_Cali: @realDonaldTrump General Michael Flynn will make a great Secretary of Defense when you become POTUS! #MakeAmericaSafeAgain"I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn.
